# Process-Hierarchy-Manager
This project simulates a basic operating system's process management structure using a tree-like hierarchy. Each process is represented by a table entry containing information about its parent, first child, and younger sibling. The program allows users to:
Create child processes under a specified parent.
Display the current state of the process table.
Destroy all descendants of a selected process recursively.

Processes are managed dynamically using a fixed-size table initialized by the user. This project demonstrates tree traversal, dynamic memory allocation, and structured data handling in C.
